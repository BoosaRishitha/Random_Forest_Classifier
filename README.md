# Random_Forest_Classifier

# Project Title :
Classify the Random_Forest algorithm using skit.learn classifier "RandomForestClassifier" for iris.csv, and pedict the data how many species are interconnected with nth Decision tree node.

# Task-1 :
Import the RandomForestClassifier by using sklearn.ensemble library.
# Task-2 :
Load your data using seaborn graphics library as arguement load_iris().
# Task-3 :
Preprocess the data using skitlearn graphics library.
# Task-4 :
Select the model using "model_selection" from sns as a seaborn and sklearn as a skitlearn machine learning library.
# Task-5 :
Load iris.csv dataset for data as a input variable and target as the functionable output variable.
# Task-6 :
Pick the train and test data using arguemental library train_test_split.
# Task-7 :
Select the estimators as the nth Decision tree.
# Task-8 :
Use a RandomForestClassifier and fit your model.
# Task-9 :
Find out your accuracy model.

# Accuracy

# Conclusion :
My model has approach 1.00 accuracy, which is lies between in the range of 0 to 1.
Hence it is shows that RandomForestDecision model successfully implement.
